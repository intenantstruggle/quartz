The purpose of ETOC is to create new autonomous tenant unions.\n\nETOC is part of the Housing Justice Commision (HJC), which is part of [DSA](https://www.dsausa.org/). The HJC implements [Resolution 21](https://convention2021.dsausa.org/2021-dsa-convention-resolutions/#P1U), which was voted on at a recent DSA Convention.\n\nETOC runs two training programs. The first one is a 2 Day intensive training that introduces tenant organizing at an intermediate level. The second one is a Mentorship program that pairs cohorts with experienced mentors who work through a 5-phase process of building a tenant union.\n\nETOC held its first 2 Day training in May 2022. In 2022, over 100 people from 17 DSA chapters were trained, and 6 cities were in active mentorship to create new ATUs, with another 4 in the process to begin mentorship.","lastmodified":"2023-01-30T06:29:58.053408112Z","tags":null}}
