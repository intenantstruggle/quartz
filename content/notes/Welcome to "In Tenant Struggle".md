{{Welcome to "In Tenant Struggle"}}

In 2022, the Housing Justice Commission began a new project called [ETOC](obsidian://open?vault=intenantstruggle&file=What%20is%20ETOC%3F), the Emergency Tenant Organizing Committee. Through this new project, we are facing many novel challenges as we support the growth of the US tenants movement.

Organizers often donâ€™t leave enough documentation about their approach to work and difficulties they face. This blog is a place where 2023 Steering Committee members of the DSA Housing Justice Commission can share these ideas quickly. Enjoy, and we look forward to any feedback or questions!
